# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying as expected. The problem is likely caused by incorrect configuration or missing steps in the setup process. The solution involves verifying Tailwind's configuration and ensuring the necessary build process is in place.

## Problem
In the provided code, a simple div element is styled using Tailwind CSS classes, including background color, hover effects, text styling, and padding. However, the styles do not render correctly. This is a common occurrence, especially when working with frameworks or build processes.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and integrated into your project. This typically involves:

1. **Verify Tailwind Configuration:** Make sure the `tailwind.config.js` file correctly points to your CSS files and includes any necessary content configurations.
2. **Check PostCSS Configuration:** Ensure your PostCSS configuration is set up to work with Tailwind. This may involve installing and configuring postcss-cli, autoprefixer, or similar tools.
3. **Build Process:** If your project uses a build process, like Webpack, Vite, or others, ensure that the Tailwind CSS plugin is correctly set up to process your styles during the build step. This may require adding plugins or updating your build configuration files.
4. **Purge unused styles:** Enable purging in Tailwind config (or use `@layer base` if applicable) to remove any unused styles in production.
5. **Inspect browser devtools:** Check the browser's developer tools to see if the CSS is being applied, inspect network tab to see if any errors in css processing. The absence of Tailwind classes in the 'Elements' panel suggests that the classes aren't being compiled correctly, and there may be issues in your Tailwind configuration or build process.
6. **Check for typos:** Carefully check for any typos in your class names.
